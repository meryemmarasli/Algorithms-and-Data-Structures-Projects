# Overview of Projects and Labs Completed in Algorithms and Data Strucutres

Project A1:  Algorithmn finds one legal filling of the squares of a given crossword puzzle and the score of a filling (if a legal filling exists). Implemented with  a backtracking algorithm and dictionary

Project A2: Implements an AutoComplete algorithmn that reads in a file of words and creates a DLB trie. The users type in a letter and the program prints out possible words that they could be typing in based on the file of words received.

Project A4: Loads from a file (whose name is input by the user) a list of all of the service routes that the airline runs. The data is organized as a graph with multiple weights (distance, price) and uses algorithms such as Dijkstra's Algorithmn. 

Lab One (Boggle Solver): A program that finds all words of at least length three in a Boggle Board. The board and dictionary are read from input files
